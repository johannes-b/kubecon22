# Hands-off features releases with Keptn, OpenFeature, and OpenTelemetry - KubeCon 2022, Detroit, US

This repository contains the content and artifacts to perform the demo as shown by the KubeCon talk: *Hands-off features releases with Keptn, OpenFeature, and OpenTelemetry*. 

**Abstract:** *Releasing a new feature into production always comes with an inherent risk of introducing issues. The code may have been thoroughly tested in lower environments but differences like environment specific configurations can cause unexpected behaviour. Feature flagging helps reduce this risk by allowing a subset of users to verify a new feature in production before exposing it to all. But how can we achieve hands-off feature release automation?*

*This session will demonstrate how feature flagging and life-cycle orchestration work together to automate feature releases. Keptn will be the orchestration layer to automate feature validation. It works with OpenFeature to control access to the feature itself, allowing automated tests to verify a feature before it's generally available to users. Keptn will then react on the test results by either progressively enabling the feature for all users or initiating a troubleshooting workflow using OpenTelemetry.* 

**Goal:** *The goal of this talk is to inspire community consideration of various methods of end-to-end production testing and to demonstrate to the power of integrating multiple CNCF projects to solve real world problems. We will be utilizing several projects including OpenFeature, Keptn, and OpenTelemetry.*
